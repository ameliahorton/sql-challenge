# sql-challenge

This assignment challenges us to use six csv files to create an entity relationship diagram (ERD), create a database in PGAdmin, populate it with data from the files, and query our database. Going through all of the trial and error of this process brought me from feeling completely lost in PGAdmin to feeling like a pro. The most helpful thing for me was to draw out all of my queries on paper first before trying to type them in so that I understood exactly what I was looking for and where I could find it. I also consulted Stack Overflow when I had trouble formatting some of my queries. Overall I think that PGAdmin is actually way more intuitive to use than I initially anticipated, and I feel confident that I will be able to use it again in the future with success.
